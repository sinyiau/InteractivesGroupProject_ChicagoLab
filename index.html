        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <pre class><p>
        ○	Using the original dataset, we created a new column called “ALL NAMES” by combining columns “Member First Name,” “Member Last Name,” and “MI” using the =CONCATENATE formula 
        ○	I then created a new sheet called “Top Repeated Offenders - BY TITLE” and hid all columns besides the following columns: 
            ■	Incident Date Time 
            ■	Title at Incident 
            ■	Current Title 
            ■	All Names
            ■	Appointed Date
    ○	To determine the top 50 users of force, I created a pivot table with “All Names” as the row and value - I then filtered by COUNTA to show the users of force with 16 or more incidents. 
    ○	I then filtered by those individuals and named a tab “Top 50 Use of Force” 
    ○	I duplicated the sheet and created another tab titled “Top 50 Promotion” and added another column called “Title Status” for “promotion,” “demotion,” or “not changed” based on “title at incident” compared to “current title” 
    ○	Finally, I created a pivot table to determine the number of demotions, promotions or unchanged positions for the top 50 users of force with “Title Status” as row and value

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <pre calss><p>
○	TRR data was combined with CIT training data which included:
    ■	Officer name
    ■	Officer star number
    ■	Date of CIT certification
○	Each TRR report was coded (1,0) to indicate whether the reporting officer had CIT training before the event date
○	A separate table was created to deduplicate UoF events (multiple TRR reports are often made for the same event)
○	Each event was coded (1,0) for whether or not a CIT trained officer was involved in the response
○	Each event was additionally coded (1,0) for its relation to a mental health issue
○	Additional columns were added to capture the event date as well as several other criteria for exploratory data analysis (Beat, TRR Type, Subject Injury)
○	For the pie charts the total percentage of CIT trained officer responses to mental health and overall UoF incidents were calculated accordingly:
    ■	COUNTIFS([CIT Trained Officer?],1,[Mental Health],1)/COUNTIF([Mental Health],1)
    ■	COUNTIF(CIT Trained Officer?,1]/COUNT([Year])
○	For the volume over time chart, the proportion of UoF incidents with CIT trained officers present for each year were calculated accordingly:
    ■	COUNTIFS([Year],year,[CIT Trained Officer?],1,[Mental Health?],1)/COUNTIFS([Year],year,[Mental Health?],1)
    ■	COUNTIFS([Year],year,[CIT Trained Officer?],1)/COUNTIF([Year],year)

            ●	Using the original dataset, we created a new column called “ALL NAMES” by combining columns “Member First Name,” “Member Last Name,” and “MI” using the =CONCATENATE formula (textjoin also works)
            ●	Then, I made a pivot table to determine which members had the most TRR offenses by sum (see ‘Pivot Table 4’ in the data). I selected the ones with 4 or more TRR reports for ease. 
                ○	The pivot table was set up as follows:

                        ○ Since that allowed me to identified the offending officers, I went back to the original dataset and filtered it by the officers I wanted to focus on. See the sheet “Top Officer Offenders”. 
                ●	I made a second pivot table (see ‘Pivot Table 5’) to get each       officers’ individual TRR counts, the level of force in these incidents, and the sum. I did this to calculate the average per officer, but this could be a table in and of itself.

        <p>For this visualization, all the 90,075 calls were pivoted on their initial dispatch. And this was then sequentially presented on a pie-chart on flourish.</p>

        <p>For this visualization, the call data was pivoted on the mental health scenarios in the final dispatch.  This reduced the total calls to 22,279 and divided them into 8 categories. The final dispatch labelled ‘unauth absence’ has been expanded to the label ‘unauthorized absence’ in the final visualization.</p>

            1.	        Kari cleaned data
            2.	Deleted all entries from January 2025, so remaining data in sheet covers whole year of 2024 (Jan 1 through Dec 31)					
            3.	Create blank column to right of Column C then split text to columns in Column C to separate time and date - now split into "Date Call Received" and "Time Call Received (On day listed C)”
            4.	Filter Column I ("Final Disposition") with "Z", which is the code used by CPD to identify mental health-related cases					
            5.	Create new sheet "2. Disposition Z" by pasting special values only
            6.	Bold and freeze top row					
            7.	Create pivot table "3. Z Verification" to establish whether the values are correct
            8.	Identified two entries that were picked up that did not have "Z" in the code to identify a mental health situation but rather had "Z" in the body of the text. Those were highlighted and were removed:			
            "5087 - INJURY TO CITIZEN ON PUB." (6 total) and "0495 - BATT/AGG SENIOR CITIZEN" (13 total). Cumulative total is 19. Removed those 19 entries in "2. Disposition - Z" sheet
            9.	Create filter by condition "is empty" on "2. Disposition - Z" to establish how many of the 8913 calls (recorded with a "Z" in the number code to identify mental health related) do not list a call received time
            10.	Copy and paste special values for sheet into "4. No time entry"
            11.	372 rows empty - subtracting 1 for the header row - equals 371 entries without a recorded time for call received. Noted at bottom of viz	
            12.	Changed time format in D "Time Call received" to 24-hour style with leading zero for hour
            13.	Insert blank column to right of H, titled "Time Call Received (Rounded)” and paste in "Hour Call Received (listed in C)" from Column D
            14.	Create column to the right (Column G - "Hour of call" and Column H "Minute of call") then split text to columns from G and format numbers in G as 00	
            15.	Pivot table "8. By hour" then establish number of calls by hour then paste special values only into "9. Hourly Values" and sort by descending

1)	Follows on from steps 1 – 12 above
2)	Inserted column to the right of Column D and name "Time period of call"
3)	"Added formula (generated with AI after an extensive process): =IF(ISBLANK(D2), ""Unknown"", IF(AND(D2 >= TIME(0,0,0), D2 < TIME(6,0,0)), ""00:00 - 05:59 (Night)"", IF(AND(D2 >= TIME(6,0,0), D2 < TIME(12,0,0)), ""06:00 - 11:59 (Morning)"", IF(AND(D2 >= TIME(12,0,0), D2 < TIME(18,0,0)), ""12:00 - 17:59 (Afternoon)"", ""18:00 - 23:59 (Evening)""))))"
4)	Visual check indicates that results are accurate, so created pivot table "5. Time Breakdown" for "Time period of call"
5)	Additional verification of results is that 371 are listed as "Unknown", consistent with earlier finding. 8912 total is consistent with total number too.

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>1. There are five types of initial dispatches, after discussion with Kari, we decided to eliminate check wellbeing calls. Therefore, this chart is done based on the 22,279 mental health 911 calls in Chicago in 2024.</p>

<p>2. I created the chart aiming to show how these calls went from initial dispatch to final dispatch, and finally to final disposition. I filtered each type of initial dispatch, then used pivot tables to get the number of final dispatches.</p>

<p>3. Kari explained to us that all disposition codes ending in Z are mental health-related. Since the data came like 0520Z - ASSAULT AGG KNIFE, I split text into columns and filtered out non-mental health disposition codes. From here, I sorted the Final Dispatch: mental health related, non-mental health related, 988 calls and Cares&alternatives. The reason why I put 988 calls and Cares&alternatives separately is because they are mental health only service.</p>

<p>4. The pivot tables for final disposition were very long because there are different codes under the same type, for example, 15IZ - Inhalator;MenHlth;Ho and 15PZ - Inhalator;MenHlth;Ot. Many of these codes only orrcured once or twice. Therefore, I screened out code types with more than 10 counts. Most of the disposition codes could be confirmed, but one abbreviation was confusing: Other Mis (disposition code 19.)</p>

<p>5. For the chart, as there are a total of three stages, I checked how the flourish sankey chart sample data sheet worked. Then I divided the type of calls into source and destination, and marked step 0 to step 1 (initial dispatch to final dispatch) and step 1 to step 2 (final dispatch to final disposition.)</p>
